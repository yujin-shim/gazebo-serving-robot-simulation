# Project

## task1 - mapping & localization 

- cafe world
- using gmapping and map_server, map the world and save as .pgm & yaml file
- localication is done by AMCL node

## task2 - navigation
- navigation using move_base,global & local planner

## task3 - mission for serving robot
- used state machine, waypoints were given as constant(list)
### mission 
- starting from #1
- move through #2 - #3 - #4 - #5 - #6

## Details
### Local map parameters  
While a larger local costmap can provide more information about the environment and potentially improve path planning, it also comes with some drawbacks.  
As the local costmap increases in size, there is a possibility of the sensor capturing noisy data or mistakenly recognizing obstacles that are located farther away.

- width & height : 5

  The robot encounters difficulty when navigating corners, repeatedly recalculating the local path.

- width & height : 1.5

  The robot shows smooth cornering
